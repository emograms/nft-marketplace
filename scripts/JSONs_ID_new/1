There will be only 99 of these tokens, and no new tokens will be minted at any time. Owners of the specific emogram NFTs can burn 11 of these SRT tokens to redeem a physical sculpture of the specific Emogram NFT. Buyers would only be able to redeem the sculpture if they are the owner of the specific NFT. Users are able to buy just the SRT tokens, without the NFT, but the only use case for these tokens are the redemption of the sculptures.", "external_url": "nft.emograms.com"}
